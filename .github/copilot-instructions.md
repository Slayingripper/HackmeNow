# HackmeNow - Hacking Simulation Game

This is a web-based hacking simulation game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game simulates realistic hacking scenarios including:

- Network monitoring and packet sniffing (Wireshark-like interface)
- Terminal/shell operations
- Remote code execution (RCE)
- Camera and IoT device monitoring
- Bluetooth and WiFi sniffing
- Banking credential theft simulation
- Desktop environment simulation

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- Implement modular architecture with separate classes for different game systems
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Implement realistic terminal animations and typing effects
- Use async/await for simulated network operations
- Follow semantic HTML structure
- Use CSS custom properties for theming

## Key Components

- `GameEngine`: Main game controller and state management
- `Terminal`: Realistic terminal emulator with command processing
- `WiresharkSimulator`: Network packet capture and analysis interface
- `DesktopEnvironment`: Simulated desktop with windows and applications
- `NetworkMonitor`: Real-time network activity visualization
- `StorylineManager`: Progression system and narrative elements
- `SecurityTools`: Collection of simulated hacking tools and exploits

## Security Note

This is a simulation for educational purposes only. All "hacking" activities are simulated and do not involve real systems or networks.
