# HackmeNow - Complete Walkthrough Guide

## üéØ Overview

This walkthrough will guide you through the complete HackmeNow hacking simulation experience, from initial access to final objectives. Follow these steps to master all aspects of the game and learn essential cybersecurity concepts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Boot Sequence
1. **Start the Game**: Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser
2. **Watch the Boot**: Observe the realistic hacker terminal startup sequence
3. **Wait for Completion**: The boot will complete automatically after showing initialization messages
4. **Desktop Loads**: You'll see the main hacker desktop interface with multiple windows

### Step 2: Understanding the Interface
The game interface consists of several key components:
- **Terminal Window**: Your primary command interface (bottom-left)
- **Wireshark Window**: Network packet analysis tool (top-left)
- **Network Monitor**: Real-time traffic visualization (top-right)
- **File Explorer**: Browse target file systems (bottom-right)
- **Mission Panel**: Track objectives and progress (right side)

## üîç Phase 1: Initial Reconnaissance

### Step 3: Terminal Orientation
1. **Click the Terminal window** to focus it
2. **Type `help`** and press Enter to see all available commands
3. **Review the command list** - these are your primary hacking tools

üí° **Secret Demo Mode**: Type `help --hidden` to reveal secret commands including `demo-autoplay` which runs an automated demonstration of the entire game walkthrough!

### Step 4: Network Discovery
```bash
# Start with basic network scanning
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
```
This command will:
- Discover all devices on the home network
- Show open ports and services
- Identify potential targets (smartphones, IoT devices, computers)

**Expected Results:**
- Router at 192.168.1.1
- Smart TV at 192.168.1.105
- iPhone at 192.168.1.102
- Security camera at 192.168.1.108
- Windows PC at 192.168.1.110

### Step 5: Service Enumeration
```bash
# Get detailed information about specific targets
nmap -sV 192.168.1.105
nmap -sV 192.168.1.110
```
This reveals:
- Operating systems
- Running services
- Version numbers
- Potential vulnerabilities

## üì° Phase 2: Traffic Monitoring

### Step 6: Start Packet Capture
1. **Open Wireshark Window**: Click on the Wireshark interface
2. **Start Capture**: Click the green "Start" button
3. **Monitor Traffic**: Watch real-time packets flowing through the network

### Step 7: Analyze Captured Data
Look for interesting packet types:
- **HTTP Traffic**: Unencrypted web browsing
- **FTP Transfers**: File transfer protocols
- **SMTP/POP3**: Email communications
- **Telnet**: Unencrypted remote access

### Step 8: Extract Credentials
```bash
# Use terminal to extract credentials from packet capture
wireshark --extract-creds
```
This command will:
- Parse captured packets for login attempts
- Extract usernames and passwords
- Show authentication tokens
- Identify session cookies

**Common Findings:**
- Bank login: `john.doe@email.com / Password123`
- WiFi password: `HomeNetwork2024`
- Router admin: `admin / default`

## üéØ Phase 3: System Exploitation

### Step 9: WiFi Network Penetration
```bash
# Crack WiFi using captured handshake
aircrack-ng --wordlist rockyou.txt capture.cap
```
This simulates:
- WPA/WPA2 handshake capture
- Dictionary attack on WiFi password
- Network access escalation

### Step 10: Router Exploitation
```bash
# Access router admin panel
ssh admin@192.168.1.1

# Or use web interface exploit
exploit --type router --target 192.168.1.1
```
Router access allows:
- Network traffic routing
- DNS spoofing
- Firewall rule modification
- Device isolation

### Step 11: IoT Device Compromise
```bash
# Exploit smart TV vulnerability
exploit --type smart-tv --target 192.168.1.105

# Access security camera
exploit --type camera --target 192.168.1.108
```
IoT exploitation provides:
- Device control and monitoring
- Microphone/camera access
- Network lateral movement
- Persistent backdoor installation

## üíª Phase 4: Computer System Access

### Step 12: Windows PC Penetration
```bash
# Use Metasploit framework
metasploit
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.110
exploit
```
This simulates:
- SMB vulnerability exploitation
- Remote code execution
- Meterpreter shell access
- System privilege escalation

### Step 13: File System Exploration
```bash
# Browse compromised system
ls /home/
ls /Documents/
cat /Documents/passwords.txt
cat /Documents/banking_info.txt
```
Look for valuable files:
- Password databases
- Banking information
- Personal documents
- Cryptocurrency wallets

### Step 14: Credential Harvesting
```bash
# Extract stored passwords
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt shadow.txt

# Dump browser passwords
exploit --type browser-creds --target 192.168.1.110
```
Harvest various credentials:
- System user passwords
- Browser saved passwords
- Application login tokens
- Email account access

## üí∞ Phase 5: Financial Exploitation

### Step 15: Banking Access
```bash
# Use harvested credentials to access banking
ssh -p 443 john.doe@bankportal.com

# Or simulate web banking access
exploit --type banking --credentials john.doe:Password123
```

### Step 16: Transaction Monitoring
1. **Monitor Bank Traffic**: Use Wireshark to capture banking sessions
2. **Extract Session Tokens**: Capture authentication cookies
3. **Session Hijacking**: Use tokens for unauthorized access

### Step 17: Fund Transfer
```bash
# Simulate unauthorized transfer
transfer --from 123456789 --to 987654321 --amount 5000
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: This is completely simulated - no real money is involved!

## üïµÔ∏è Phase 6: Stealth and Persistence

### Step 18: Cover Your Tracks
```bash
# Clear system logs
exploit --type log-cleaner --target 192.168.1.110

# Remove access traces
clearlogs --system --network --application
```

### Step 19: Install Backdoors
```bash
# Install persistent access
backdoor --install --target 192.168.1.110 --type service
backdoor --install --target 192.168.1.105 --type firmware
```

### Step 20: Data Exfiltration
```bash
# Copy sensitive files
cp /Documents/sensitive/* /tmp/exfil/
tar -czf stolen_data.tar.gz /tmp/exfil/
nc -l 4444 < stolen_data.tar.gz
```

## üéÆ Advanced Techniques

### Social Engineering Simulation
```bash
# Simulate phishing attack
phishing --generate-email --target john.doe@email.com
phishing --clone-site --url bankportal.com
```

### Advanced Persistence
```bash
# Rootkit installation
rootkit --install --target 192.168.1.110
rootkit --hide-process backdoor.exe
rootkit --hide-network-connection 4444
```

### Cryptocurrency Mining
```bash
# Install cryptominer on compromised systems
cryptominer --install --target 192.168.1.110
cryptominer --configure --pool mining.pool.com --wallet your_wallet
```
